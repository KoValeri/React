    title: "Until Eternity",
    text: `I loved you once, I loved you twice
I loved you in my previous lives
I know your voice, I know your eyes
You haunt me through my dreams at night
Oh my love we'll meet again
We always do in the end
Our two souls destined to be
You and I until eternity`,

  {
    title: "Demons",
    text: `When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now (unless you show me how)`,
  },
  {
    title: "Back From The Dead",
    text: `Back from the dead alive
Hell couldn't hold me
Back from the other side
Up from the dirt I rise
Save your prayers, don't bless my bones
Erase my name from my headstone
Back from the dead alive
Hell couldn't hold me down`,
  },
  {
    title: "Falling Forever",
    text: `Are you good at holdin' on?
I know the mind is quick to throw away the moment
Where this takes us, maybe I don't wanna know yet
'Cause for now you're all I want
They say you got it, then it's gone
I don't believe that every flame has to get colder
I hope the feelings that you give me carry over
'Til tomorrow and beyond`,

  {
    title: "This Is The Life",
    text: `Oh the wind whistles down
The cold dark street tonight
And the people they were dancing
To the music vibe
And the boys chase the girls, with curls in their hair
While the shocked too many sit way over there
And the songs get louder each one better than before
And you singing the song thinking this is the life`,
  },
  {
    title: "No Longer You",
    text: `I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of man
I see portrayals of betrayal
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death
I see you draw your final breath
I see a man who gets to make it home alive
But it's no longer you`,
  },
  {
    title: "Master Of Puppets",
    text: `End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you`,
